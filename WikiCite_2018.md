# Hack on the Author Disambiguator!

* How does what you’re doing map to WikiCite’s past, present, future?
  -
  - Having author items rather than just names (in Wikidata) enriches citation data
  
* What would help you be more integrated with other WikiCite activities?
  -
  - Encouraging people adding articles to add (this or another) author disambiguation step

* What would help you move this idea forward during the course of the day?

1. Try it out: https://tools.wmflabs.org/author-disambiguator/
  - It already does more than the old SourceMD new-resolve-authors!
2. If something breaks, or you have an idea, create an issue: https://github.com/arthurpsmith/author-disambiguator/issues
3. If you know any PHP, you can help fixing issues
